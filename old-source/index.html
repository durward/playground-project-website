      <h1>Welcome to our playground scorecard portal!</h1>
      <p>With this site, you can see the data we've compiled for playgrounds throughout Boston.
        These are playgrounds that we have visited ourselves and have run our scorecard to get
        a better sense of how these playgrounds are meeting the needs of the communities.
        You can view our data in a few different ways:<p>
      <div class='list'>
        <p><strong>Results:</strong> Here you will find a table of all the playgrounds that have been scored.
          You can filter based on the different scores and search for a specific playground that you might be looking for.
          You can also sort by each of the different scores. A full explanation of the different scores can be found below.</p>
        <p><strong>Map:</strong> This map will show the locations of all the scored playgrounds.
          Again, it is filterable by score. You can click on the waypoints to see more information about the space.</p>
        <p><strong>Report:</strong> As we have been running this scorecard, we have made some interesting findings.
          You can learn more about those by reading our report.</p>
        <p><strong>Misc.:</strong> Just some fun visualizations that looked cool!</p>
        <p><strong>Survey:</strong> Want to fill out our survey yourself? Click on the link in the sidebar to be taken to our google form.
          Once you have finished the survey, head on back here to view the results!</p>
      </div>

      <p>Our survey is divided into three major sections. Each section represents a different aspect of the playground's quality.
        We use the data gathered to calculate a subscore for each of these categories. Finally, we compute an overall score.
        Here is an explanation of the different subjects:<p>
      <div class='list'>
        <p><strong>Features and Functions:</strong> The different types of elements and amenities a park has.
          We look for things like fencing, restrooms, shade, seating, a variety of styles of play equipment, etc.</p>
        <p><strong>Maintenance and Safety:</strong> How well the playground is being maintained, and how safe the area is from various hazards.</p>
        <p><strong>Inclusivity:</strong> What play equipment does the playground have to meet the needs of children with various disabilities.</p>
